Won't make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It's also the best exchange rate on points. Go points equals Monye instead of like some of the others where it takes ok points to reach no etc..Also, APPLIKE aap very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Paypal. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Paypal for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day!"
1,Faisaluddin Ahmed,11 March 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,102,"One of the most useful apps for the modern era. Its really having many facilities which would not be describe in terms if words. Thanks Paytm team for the awesome apps I gave 4 star because of many functions and helpful apps.

2,akshat jain,12 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,31,"Very convenient for on the go mobile recharge. Have had trouble with payments a couple of times but have got the refund every time except once. Would not use it ever again if I face such an issue in the future. Till then 4 star. Changed it to 5 star because clearly, its great. From 2015 to now."
3,A Google user,13 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,10,"Worst Service when comes to Bank Transactions. Original Banks are banks investing on quality of service. Payment Banks are just surviving with poor technical setup. My OTP is delayed minimum 2 or 3 hours when transaction fails. The UPI setup remains incomplete, banks fails to validate message send from SIM Cards. Time to switch back to Core Banks."
4,Tarique Moin Shaikh,12 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,122,"customer service is very rude and cheap. i have called them and after 20 min long conversation they put me on hold now its 45 and no one is responding on call. the person on call told that i am a chutiya. and they were unable to help customers then why they are in market, and when i post a review they want me to talk to them in person..."
5,Bhavin Patel,12 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1819,"worst paytm customer care service. from last many days i am not able to set my UPI id and not able to delete my bank account, i raise query from paytm app then too not resolve. whenever i call customer care they are not picking up call. even for updation of kyc we have to visit their store there also person misbehaving with us. worst service. i suggest not to use paytm."
6,Karan Kumar,12 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,40,"I am using paytm since 2014. Now I am feeling cheated, Paytm has stopped allowing to add money from credit card. As I am salaried employee, paytm was helpful for maintaining day to day transaction. If paytm is not going to change policy, then ultimately I will have to uninstall Paytm.🤪🤪🤪"
7,Doreen Fernandes,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,137,I want to uninstall the app and have no more dealings with Paytm as I am unable to use my balance payment to pay. They are insisting on the KYC process but in spite of several complaints my issue has not been resolved. They keep sending me useless links which do not work. They have responded with a link to their helpline but the issue remains unresolved.
8,SOORAJ S,12 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,24,the app is not saying about kyc while depositing money in the paytm wallet. Now on paying any thing it is saying about to complete the kyc. So for the kyc I should visit the nearest kyc centre and give pan detail and aadhar card which is about 25 km from my home..
9,Abhishek Bandyopadhyay,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,21,"Super laggy and buggy. Most of the time, the scan and pay option will freeze. Hate to see such a downfall for this app. I was quite hooked into the platform when their KYC policy started bothering me up. Without the KYC done, you can't use the wallet which is fine by Govt. Norms. But they don't have a in app KYC uploading policy or they have good KYC points. They claim that the KYC can be done freely but all of their KYC points charge 20 bucks for the process. Super pathetic customer support."
10,A Google user,9 March 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,1060,Using Paytm for last few years...Disappointed with Customer Service issues.....Even KYC issues are not handled appropriately...Serious interospection... Got standard replies...The comments I have posted are after due procedure of Customer care Tickets and phone follow up... No response from customer care
11,yusuf kushurian,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,109,"Worst service, no one picks paytm mall number. It always says executives are busy with other customers. No reply to messages sent to paytm. Moreover, returns are not picked up on time, pickup boy always marks it as failed without even trying."
12,Babita Kundu,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,23,I tried to book the flight tickets thru paytm aap..made the payment and after few secs transaction failed. but i only received 50% of money i paid as a refund. i feel like i have been cheated by paytm. i m sure there will be many more like me.
13,Mohan Durga Prasad,10 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,148,I have tried to recharge on paytm and selected number from recent list and clicked on proceed. After selected it has done payment thru wallet immediately. This is happened only because of automatic selection of fast forward default selected. Pls remove this automatic selected. I never use paytm for recharge again. Pls work on this immediately. I am huge fan of paytm.. Dont lose the credibility.
14,Koihei Hauz,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,40,paytm is good honestly speaking. but paytm mall is not good at all. I brought computer mouse 8 piece but only two working. and the item has no return policy. I don't deserve to be fooled and nobody does. this was my lack of awareness and fully trusted with paytm mall. I wish I could really go in back time. fooled man fooled man ya that's me.
15,Neeta Singh,12 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,11,No proper reply even after complaining at 24×7. Under the offer section there is offer called Megha offer earn up to 1500 rs but in the term and conditions it's not given that how much we will earn during recharge or payment. its not explained how we will get 1500 rs will it be in parts or at once. amount is huge but no explanation means you are making people fool.
16,Pankaj Tirpude,8 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,202,"Whenever I try to make some urgent transaction, it always doesn't work. The app either crashes or it makes transaction unsuccessful. But when there is time to add money in wallet it runs faster. That's not fair Paytm."
17,YASDIP GADHIYA,11 March 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,13,"less Cashback offer, when I starting new account Cashback offer more but today I am daily custom then no Cashback offer received.

20,Fahir M E,9 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,90,Their KYC completion is a Herculean and disappointing task. i have subbmitted all documents and my wallet is still locked and my money blocked. I spent 750 Rs for paytm first and this was thr first reward/privilege I got
21,Mohammad Aijaz Khan,13 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,2,"I have been using this app, I couldn't understand why paytm is sending me the message that I have to pay Rs 209 and the money is due for payment. I am ready to pay but please let me know the context for which bill the amount is due. Thanks, Dr khan"
22,Atul Deshmukh,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,19,"worst and pathetic app and customer care service and resolution process. there is no way to raise a query for a failed transaction. you are simply saying try it one more time. i was trying to pay the credit card bill , money got deducted from my savings account and instead of making payment to merchant, paytm transferred to my wallet withiut my requirements and now charging me 4%as transfer charges for sending it back to my savings account. dont use this app at all"
23,Rahul,9 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,352,Started using paytm almost after a year due to Aadhar and Privacy issues. Increasing my rating to 5 from earlier 3. The app has become a perfect digital solution to almost everything. I just hope that user privacy stays at the top of their priority.
24,Pikasu Sinha,12 March 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,3,There is no option to raise network related queries within the app. also no cust care no for same .. App is very slow. very disappointed.. .App takes too much time to load .. It's very slow... Many times it also crashes..plz do something.. Overall it's good though..!!

26,Jubil Mathew,8 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,43,"Since RBI extends KYC compliance by six months so please give us relaxation customers . My E KYC expired today now unable to do transactions. So planning to close A/C because for doing KYC, centres are asking money. No way to contact customer care on phone immediate help"
27,Banibrata Dutta,11 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,2,"When it works, it works. Updates and some other obscure cases sometimes wipeout login information and you need to do through some painful relogin procedure. Works decent only on WiFi and good 4G coverage, but not so well in slow mobile data. Also their full KYC mandate is such a royal pain in the rear end. Why must one travel 6kms away in crazy traffic for in-person full KYC to be told that the centre doesn't do the personal KYC anymore. Switched to Google Pay."
28,keithellakpam somendro,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,16,bad app..... I try to reacharge a electricity bill for 2300 recharge not success but amount deducted and not refund my money and there is no helpline nos. for recharge and bill payment quarry....if paytm doesnt refund my money i will delete and broke the atm card for paytm lifetime
29,Abhinav Krishna,13 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3,The only reason I use this because people in India are so used to this. This guy put some offers and Indians always wanted that. The real truth is this is the worst service. This guy is a money looter. This app is Shame of India. He is looting you all. I really wanted people to switch to a different app.
30,Bhuvanesh S,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,10,Unethical customer care people (except for few). Will lie to you to just close your complaint. Have no ability to understand what customer speaks or writes. Including the escalation team. Good until you don't have to contact customer care!!
31,harshit gupta,13 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,"not able to do kyc,as all nearby kyc centres mentioned on app either say they dont do kyc or they simply do not exist...sent feedback multiple times on app with no response. doesn't have a call centre really bad experience, to transfer my back from paytm to my account they will charge 4% fees.

34,Sam Lekhi,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,32,from best to worst now. I have always recommended paytm to many of shops to do business good but they all are now complaining so as me. for 1 year i had extremely best service. Have a merchant account. first for free now theres a charge of 4% on bank transfers + instead of increasing postpaid balance they took off postpaid from me even when i made all payments before time. I am so delighted with other providers. had 2 merchant accounts on paytm. took them off and so as recommend people not to use
35,Harshad Sapre,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,28,"Worst customer service experienced till now. Gives irrelevant and irritating solutions because agents are not able to understand the problem. There fix reply is ""we have marked this resolved"" where the problem is unsolved. Finally i got that customer care is not able to help me or they may not be capable to help. Dear paytm do not reply this review because you will be giving mail id which will give same irritating answers. And you do not understand my concern."
36,Sanket Kamble,8 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1034,"'Payment Assist' feature is not turning off even after making it off through settings. I don't understand why don't you look after these bugs. What is happening? First, I was given an option 'Payment Limits' and set the limit. Now when I want to update the limits, it says 'No payment type supported'. Please help me. This is not acceptable. And yes you are not fixing bugs, instead you are adding more."

40,JAY RAJ KUMAR,8 March 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,48,"This is a Great app, but since its one the best app an Indian can use u have high expectations, so i deducted 2 stars for three reasons, 1. Very Poor Customer Service, if by anyway u fell into some issue, u r going to cry for ur solution. 2. Charges for Amount being Transferred from ewallet to bank accounts, at least they should allow free transfer in their own bank. 3. Paytm Mall, Very Bad quality, unverified product and wrong product delivery always."

42,Chaitanya Maheshwari,9 March 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,16,"Great app. Making our lives easy, cashless and filled with cashbacks. But, all is fine until you encounter a problem. After you encounter a problem, good luck with the support staff. Paytm customer support is the worst. They keep sending automated messages, that too after long delays, without any relevant solution, and after sometime, even don't care for automated messages, and the issue is never resolved."
43,Rahul KR,9 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,16,"slow slow slow. Have to wait very long time for the first startup and initiate payment. The shop owner gives me a look as if am using an outdated device. With Android Oreo and 6GB RAM on the device, if you can't optimize, why not a lite version?

56,Khalid Khan,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3,I have been having serious problem with paytm lately. Mobile recharge is not possible despite the passbook showing sufficient balance. It would be helpful if a customer executive was available for redressal instead of IVR.
