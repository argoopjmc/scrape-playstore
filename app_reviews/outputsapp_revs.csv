0,BAHRAICH ARYA,23 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,103210,"I loved this game i have not played this type of game in my whole life. It is the greatest game on playstore and i recommend everyone to download and play. But my only problem is about UC you can only buy from your bank account, My great request is to the developers to make such a bonus that play 1 or 2 hours in a day and get a free 10 Uc so that everyone can enjoy this game.And the Zombie update is So Awsome. Its my humble request to developers."
1,Shubham rawat,9 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,1239,"I'm facing headphone issue. i can listen music and pick up calls everything is fine with the headphones but as soon as i open pubg, my headphones doesn't work. I've tried this with other headphones but the result is same. And before all this started there was another issue that whenever someone used to call me the headphones would disconnect and will not get connected unless i restart the game. From 5 stars to 2. That's pubg story."
2,ABHIJIT ADAK,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,67783,it's a superb game.. i just loved it.. but just a request to the developers to add some weekly members at low cost for UC.. We are eager to buy elite pass but can't afford though.. if u guyz make some weekly membership at near about 200 indian currency then teenagers like us can buy those elite passes and enjoy the gameplay more.. and there is a high ping issue max of the time.. don't know how to reduce that lag cozing for that.. but plzz add some weekly or monthly memberships for us..
3,prodigal son,20 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,11521,very addictive! cant put it down. easy game and great graphics. I can play friends or people all over the world . the only thing I'd change is if your a guy you get guy stuff and if your a girl you get girl stuff. it would be nice if players or friends could trade what they have with eachother and if you buy something you should be able to keep it instead of it expiring. the cost is a little high also. if they changed those things then this game would be fire!

8,VISHNU KRANTH,11 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,260,"MORE ACHIEVEMENTS SHOULD BE ADDED! If some more achievement is added to Matches, Honour, Progress, General and Social category it will be Great. so that we'll get more achivement points, that's where the game lacks a good part. You give 50 Points for ITEMS - (Collecting a particular Set) Category but only 15, 30 points for other categories in achievement. So we need more Achievement Points. Apart from that I love everything about the game, addictive and Awesome. Well done PUBG team! Thank you..."
9,BJS REX,22 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,3942,"As Promised, 5 🌟 for the new update. Only one request is to maintain the diversity in this game too. Also, make your game players happy. If number is too much than make season 1 players happy like me with discount or buy gifts for them. It not sounds logical but the craze for this game is getting low infact season 5 royal pass is not that much satisfying and this is feedback for you guys. I Love Your hard work. I'm buying iPad for this specific game as my previous OnePlus 3T is not responding."
10,Brittney Brophy,24 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,2645,"love the game a lot, been playing since season 2. Only thing I have an issue with is the exchange rate that you guys have. i understand that from the dollar theres not much you can do. but i spend 10$ more than American players just to get the royal pass. I dont mind spending the money for that game, its the fact that im spending more but getting the same as everyone else. maybe give an extra item or an extra bit of royal points towards people who have to pay way more than other players. thnx"

14,Leonardo Taufan,26 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1985,"Most features of this game is amazing, since everything you expect from a mobile version of PUBG. Yes, it doesn't have the same bullet drop, and yes, the audio is a bit clunky sometimes, but it's clear enough so you can tell where people is. It even has features that PUBG PC don't. My only problem is they're limiting the graphics settings for this game. My phone is capable of playing this game on Smooth 60 FPS, yet it doesn't allow me to."

Jeez, it lags and makes the device [ASUS ZENFONE 3 DELUXE] heat, makes me feels like I can fry an egg. The battery drains faster than you can finish the game.

The Zombie Mode had really added great value to the game, very creative, Dificulty is good (too much dificulty will lead loss of intrest). The imp. 3 things which i expect from developers are:- 1. I love the varieties of oufits intenst, cool, hot, sexy, tough, elegant for both character. You guys doing great job, looking for more. 2. Wanna more creative like Zombie. U can also add Ancient battel mode, kind of. 3. Plz update Solder's Crate or allow to use coins for higher👍"

26,Flaysz Duke,23 February 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,1339,"as playing this game. i realize something, you still didnt even think about giving an option for extreme fps. it makes the gameplay much smoother. for midrange devices like myself with helio p60 processor phone, it can handle that fps. using a gfx tool with that kind of option. but if you still dont like gfx tool, why not make your own legal tool. im really in the middle whether or not to delete this game. consider this comment, and i know you will have an improved addicting game."
27,jatin,5 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,250,"Updates of the game are nearly equal to the game size, they should be half to the size of game. I have a high end device, a high speed connection and still face frame drops when there are enemy near me. Mic and speaker of in-game voice chat sometimes don't work and we cannot communicate with a certain team mate. Interesting new themes, new maps, cool ""achievement"" skins, superb graphics,easy controls and new tactic to play every new game."

This game was a real time play. and now you guys have brought us back to zombie shooting. you guys should've included wild animals/ predators, cheetah tigers lions etc in a jungle instead of zombies in a room which makes it completely unreal. Rest its a good game."
29,A Google user,27 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,539,"Respected Tencent, There are many people in NEPAL who plays PUBG mobile. But we always face ping issues while playing, we are matched against the player who have 20-30ms but we get 200ms. So it is a request from all the Nepali players, “Please add us in the INDIAN server” because if we get matched in Indian server then we will get 50-100ms which can be really beneficial for us. Please listen to your players and add us in INDIAN SERVER. Waiting for a positive reply. Thank you"
30,Arunav Dey,19 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,26191,"The game is great. Always my retreat at the end of the day. But one thing that annoys me (which is why I didn't give 5 stars) is that my phone is pretty powerful to run the game at Smooth and Extreme settings. But you have limited my maximum setting as Smooth with Medium frame rates. I play much heavy games on my phone at 60FPS. I fully believe my phone can run this game at extreme settings as well, hoping that you'd let me know if you're going to unlock this frame rate for my phone model."

I complete the Tasks and it wont actually count them towards the 10 tasks for my royal crate. I finish parts of the missions to find out the game isnt tracking it (Complete with S or higher in any Mode) A few S matches later and nothing. Support took 9 days to reply and their reply was ""Your crate rewards will be in the inventory"" Wonderful I didnt even ask about that.... Its been 13 days w/support, 0 Progress."

But now since this month before new update,my game started to close by itself while playing and keep on repeating this. So I have to reset my Tab every 4 to 5 days then it plays normally and then again this game start closing. Kindly solve this issue as I have now more than 6 GB free memory available but still this game is not working properly which it used to before."
33,romantic song Nepal,24 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,671,Good game but to play smooth and flawlessly you need a good smartphone with more than 4GB ram. also it have lots of bugs which need to be fix but the developers are not see on that side they rollout update in every 2months with more new bugs. They just want money from you purchase their item and give them money thats all they want. they make fool on the name of gaming.and new update very very poor i don't like zombie mood
34,Frank Drago,2 March 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,216,I'm going to give this a 3 star review for now as I'm still playing and seeing if my theory is correct or not. I don't think I'm playing with real players. I am almost certain I only play against 99 bots as i have won 4 games in a row and i have only played 4 games total... the graphics are average for 2019 on a phone game. it is fun but in my opinion it's too easy played mixed WiFi for 2 games and TMobile 4GLTE in Alaska for the other 2 and no lag or issues with signal.

35,Ayush Thapa,20 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,1635,I love this game. great graphics great content but since 1 week i'm facing problem with connection. i am playing asia server and my wifi is good. it's 20 mbps and yet i only get 200 plus ping. i have called my service provider many times but they say that it's not their problem. they said it's the main games problem. other things works properly. if i can only get proper ping in asia server i would enjoy it. my gameplay would improve.
36,Corey Walden,20 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,1451,"love it, just wish gun skins were alittle more available then being randomly given.. if I'm going to spend real money on this game consistently then I'd like to have a bit of certainty with my purchase that I'm going to get what I want not what I already have gotten 15 20 of. will 5 star if this ever comes to be."
37,Emperor Joker,20 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,1459,Its an awesome game. the only issue is that my phone overheats severally when i play. pls fix this if possible. 🙏 It would also be cool if you made a mode were everyone in the map has to work together to survive against zombies. plz? other than those suggestions i love your game! keep up the good work!👏👍👍👍👍 p.s: NEVER REMOVE ZOMBIE MODE!
38,Salon Tamang,20 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1008,"This game is soo much nice and exciting one whenever I play this game my brain just becoming fresh than I can study properly. New goast updates us awesome. I know that in some mobiles phone it's becoming lag because of there full storage or there phone is not more than 2gb ram. So, that's not a pubg mobile game problem that's your all mobile phone problem so, do not point your finger to this game by saying basmd things about. Wherever people says about this game for me this game is awesome. 👌👌"
39,Derrik Brozovich,22 February 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,607,"Here's my updated review a year later. PUBG Mobile never ceases to be fun and the latest updates and game modes are phenomenal. I decrease my rating to 3 stars as there is an overwhelming focus on micro-transactions. whwn you ooen the app, you have a handful of cards taking you to buy something. play a few matches and get a popup to buy something. every other week, ""bargin"" to buy several things. The game play can't make up for that ludicrous strategy focused on making every penny possible"

47,Tahmid Rohan,20 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1418,Great time pass game. Very addicting. But some players are using hacks that is a matter of thought.

They have the option of fighting alone (Solo), with another player (Duos), or with a team of three others (Squads).

Graphics are awesome, game UI is great, and the whole concept is great... Yeah although there is room for improvements considering the weapons are always in the specific places so once people know where there are most lethal and great weapons they used to land there only.. I would say this must be changed.... Also many times it takes more time nowadays to start the match...."

56,Jelly fans,4 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,803,Best game ever😍😍 but needs a zombie apocalypse mode in arcade. But needs more arcade mode's and a raft mode with 50 people can play. and have 1:00 to find supplies on a island then when time is up you spawn on a little raft and start with a crossbow only get 8 arrows and 4 people can play on a team. And you can sabotage other players and start with one grenade. Pls add both of these 😁😁😁😀 and a mode with 50 vs 50

I think for those who post a negative of this games is your own cellphone had a problem so much better to buy another one who capable this game and much better the big screen and get a good quality internet connection."
59,A Google user,28 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,155,The game is awesome. I loved it. i have been playing since season1. but i have been finding some problems with it. like it won't join the game but it doesn't do that much. But PUBG MOBILE TEAM good work on this awesome game the best game i seen in playstore. i also love the new update till dawn survive resdent evil 2 nice it gets foggy then dark a daylight again love it . keep up the work and change some of your prices on the clothing. pubg mobile fan forever
60,Hetal Thacker,24 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,205,"this game is too good ,I like this game and the graphics is superb the game is too likely to me and my all friends and brothers. By playing this game we get knowledge of guns. this is too good for time spending. In this game a Miramar map is not that much good and another one thing is that we should have to download the maps that is also not good. From all the I like only 3 three maps that is erangel,sanhok and vikeindi map is too good but Miramar is not good. The pubg mobile is best game"
61,Victor Gillerson,21 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,4424,needs more guns. everything is perfect. except for the fact that the bike does not have boost (it would be pretty awesome) the resident evil 2 mode is too hard. I LOVE IT!!! make it harder and this time... we gotta all survive without fighting each other. we can be a huge team of 50 or 60 people and survive. plz consider my suggestion (unless it won't work)
62,Shabbir Ahmed,28 February 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,96,"i was thinking that after updating something will change in game for example it will become more user friendly, graphics looks more realistic and errors like sometime if server dsnt responding then suddenly player exited. automatically and then player hve to restart the game.. but nothing happened like this inspite of solving these bugs you people added zombie. in which no one is interested... we like to play only the Classic mode.. please make it more user friendly improve graphics and usrcntrl"
63,Robert Martinez,24 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,245,"This might be the best phone game I've ever played. Don't even really like the PC version, so I didn't expect much from here, but I was pleasantly surprised with the controls, graphics, features and options. This is a console quality experience that will make your heart pound out of your chest. This should be a 5.0 because I can't see a single reason why someone would not be completely satsified. It's PUBG people! On a PHONE!! And it's GOOD!!! Only thing that sucks is lootboxes galore."
64,Prasenjit Raj,26 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,202,"This game, to be honest is pretty good in every aspect. But there is only a tiny problem i face sometimes. That is about the match making. Well its okay to have a lobby with players from bronze 1 to gold 4 but i have been experiencing this recently that i'm being matchmaked with a player frm platinum or diamond and thats not fair . It happens sometimes so it isnt a big issue but if u guys can fix it , the game will literally be perfect for me."
65,Joel Jasmin,7 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,199,"The game sucks after the zombie update, I have to re log in everytime it boots, everytime I finish a match it logs out as well, its crazy buggy, I've already landed yet the map hasn't even loaded yet. I've never had this problem before, map always loads before I even parachute but now I need to wait a whole minute for it to load and that's if I don't get killed, then re log in. please fix"
66,prince arya,19 February 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,1587,"i think you should have a day every week/month/or special day of no point deduction mode (only improvement)... please,😄😄 and also you should always release update of less space please... and also please do something of your lags... you can also add some feature of parent control to make your game unbann in india .. and one more advise - you should publish the top player's name of different places to make player happy.. thats all but lastly... i really like your real time shooting game..😋"
67,A Google user,21 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,559,"This game feels just like PC pubg. This review has been a long time coming. It's a must have if you like BR games and good graphics. And my one suggestion for the game devs is that if you pick up clothing from a killed player and then proceeded to win that game, you should get to keep the clothing."
68,lunis xd,9 March 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,17,In my opinion it is a very good game since you can play with your friends and everything. I would like the BP to be converted into UC so we would not have to spend our real money and apart it would be equal if we had the same right that those who buy with their real money have. ( This is my opinion ) :)
69,Akshay Nichat,6 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,211,Thanks for this amazing game But I feel that there should be slang showing action just like the dance . I mean that showing middle finger and doing three shots firing (symbol move ) like the WWE superstar HHH and Shaun. And one thing more that you should add BAZUKA weapon in supply air drops. It will be fun to play with it.. Again Thank you for this amazing game......
70,darwin noche,24 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,759,My friends has thair hd option in their devices while mine has none.. we all have balance opt.

71,Raphzor Lama,1 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,33,"First of all i dont really give reviews but this game PuBG is far better than what i expected.. Thank you so much guys for making this game.. A fair gameplay, no hackers, no stupid bugs after updates... You know what I have stopped playing lords mobile and mobile legends bang bang after installing PuBG.. Damn this game is totally addictive.. I suggest every 1 to download this game cuz its freaking addictive and fun.. Thanks for this game.. will play till i die😁😘😘"
72,Aman Raj,4 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,107,pubg never gives any legendary item in the crates that i open... i have 30 school shoes and 10 i got form classic crates.... seriously i openend all type of crate more than 300 in total and got what no legendary item.... just tell me what should i do with those 3rd class clothes... i demand pubg to provide me a shop. near gorogopool to sell all the stuff you gave... atleast that much you can do... if you cant give good items... legendary items
73,Daniel Nelson,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,749,"Great game! Updated quite often and relatively bug free, and the bugs that do show up are not game breaking unlike its predecessors on other platforms. PUBG should look upon its mobile development team and take after the passion they put into it. Preformance on my Galaxy S8 is nice, so I'd recommend a mid-grade to decent phone so you get the best experience possible."
74,Techz World - David,21 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,395,It is a very brilliant and fantastic game. But due to some resons I am unable to play pubg in my mobile. My mobile is Samsung j2 prime which have 1.5 gigabyte usable ram and very good cpu and gpu(processor) . plz make my device available in your next update.
75,kumar Vinoth,19 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,1562,"New zombie version is not much fun to play. remember pubg has breaked all the shutters in reality games, I belive only because of its beauty to play with real time players but what you guys have done now??? forgotten the morol of your success.. bringing us back to old zoombie shooting 🔫🔫🔫🔫"
76,OTM Sheldon,24 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,136,PUBG: Players Unknown Battle Grounds I like this game because its a BR game and you have all the control They could add like an option for like pubg mobile tournament I think that might be cool. Just one bad thing is that in season 2 i bought the battle pass and now i lost all the stuff from then
77,Dique Jnr,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1282,"The game is superb and i loved it so much. I play it everyday after work and classes. It's Fun, enjoyable and challenging however, i am using a 2GB RAM Samsung phone because of that i set the graphics to very low and smooth which plays well but not always. Sometimes it lag alot which gives opportunities to the enemies to kill me. Please Tencent improved game performance for low end phones. Thank you!"
78,Patrick Bretti,6 March 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,25,"have been a player since S1, great game. would like to see some more new weapons.. ive heard rumor of g36 or a scorpian or something where is it!?!? great updates so far.. never had any really big issues.. keep up the good work guys, thanks."
