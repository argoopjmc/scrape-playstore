0,Ashley Kotze,25 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,824,"Firstly, i love this game... BUT.... This update is terrible!!! My phone as well as other players phones have been overheating since the new update, everytime all my apps close in the middle of a game due to this, it makes it unpleasant. Also, the opening of doors is a real issue. A lot of players have been struggling with this. Please fix these issues."
1,Team Arrow4Life,27 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,502,"Love the game. Amazing graphics, etc. The only problem is that sometimes it does load a bit longer for mobile devices. Also, it occasionally but rarely lags a bit but I guess that's cause of the internet. Overall, great game. Highly recommend it. (Since the new resident evil update happened I've been getting laggier and laggier. Idk what's causing it but if it's the update then it has to be fixed)"
2,Vishakh Vashishtha,23 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,886,"Hi there. Just help me here please. I have collected ""145 holiday cards"" before the last update happened where you added the zombie event mode. Now I cannot use these holiday cards, which I thought I would after sometime. Now these holiday cards have 50 or maybe 60 days of validity left in them. And I want to collect that special dress you added using these holiday cards. Please help me. I have collected 145 of the holiday cards, and now I cannot use them after updating, this sucks I need ans."
3,Brittney Brophy,24 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,2650,"love the game a lot, been playing since season 2. Only thing I have an issue with is the exchange rate that you guys have. i understand that from the dollar theres not much you can do. but i spend 10$ more than American players just to get the royal pass. I dont mind spending the money for that game, its the fact that im spending more but getting the same as everyone else. maybe give an extra item or an extra bit of royal points towards people who have to pay way more than other players. thnx"
4,A Google user,25 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,155,"The Survive Till Dawn is amazing. My friends get upset because they don't get rank points but I've explained that its an Event Mode. Like the Arcade games. I absolutely love it. I think its exactly what we've been wanting. I hope they make more Maps like that one in the future. Like, maybe one with animals or Mythological Gods/Creatures. This is my all-time Favorite game. 5 Stars, hands down."
5,Leonardo Taufan,26 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1990,"Most features of this game is amazing, since everything you expect from a mobile version of PUBG. Yes, it doesn't have the same bullet drop, and yes, the audio is a bit clunky sometimes, but it's clear enough so you can tell where people is. It even has features that PUBG PC don't. My only problem is they're limiting the graphics settings for this game. My phone is capable of playing this game on Smooth 60 FPS, yet it doesn't allow me to."
6,COMm-ON kNOW-ledge,1 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3458,once again new update. more bullcrap. So hard to log in now. play 1 or 2 games and it's back to home screen. lose in a match. match has ended. return to lobby. more glitches. more bugs. close combat with 2 or more people forget it. Hackers still playing. How can you shoot and move. more updates make this game harder to play. it's pitiful really awful. the updates don't make the game better. I'm an Ace pro player. but even a bot can kill me with this update. y'all won't ever answer me 1 star now👌
7,A Google user,2 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,97,"Good gameplay, if you can actually get the app. I spent five hours trying to download this game on my slow WiFi, just for it to tell me ""Your device is not supported at the moment, but will be in a later time."" Heres an idea: say what brands are actually supported. I hope this is improved in the future, but intill then, my review will be a two."
8,A Google user,4 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,173,"what the hell did you do in the new zombie update. i love this game before but now I am thinking to uninstall it. because of the leg of game, bugs, server problem, etc and so on. you need to fix this bug and lag problem in the upcoming update. i can not even play a singal game properly because of that lag. i am requesting to you to do something. please do something."
9,A Google user,24 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,474,I don't know what the hell is wrong with this recent update. The game just lags way too much. Before this update it was not like this at all. It lagged but didn't bother my gameplay. After this update I couldn't play even a single game my way. Can't land in hotspots - game freezes immediately after landing and I'm dead. Shooting enemies continuously and they don't die. Everything is wrong. Just can't play the game at all.
10,A Google user,23 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,109,"bad, very bad experience, this game is completely out of order now, I have been playing this game for 6 months, but now this is a complete trash, I really recommend those who are not playing this game not to play this game ever. It will be your brutal experience,trust me, whereas there are a lot of other better games you can play, like even fortnite is way better then this game. Stayyyyyyy away from this trash.. Really desappointed."
11,remnickson victor,25 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,185,"bad just bad. when we entered the plane, it just stuck at there. and it is not a rare occurence, i could say 6 out of 10 times, it will lag like that. i never had this problem before, until the latest update. i already played this for months until this latest update. most of this problem occurs when i am playing on vikendi's map. pls developer, pls fix it asap"
12,_ Zen_,27 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,502,Latest update sucks. A lot of glitches and bugs. Sometimes my character doesn't appear in the game's home screen. Why you people bringing new bugs and glitches on each update. I loved this game once but not anymore. The game is becoming more and more laggy on each update. Sometimes it kicks me out of the game for no reason while I'm in a match. When are you guys gonna fix these. I'm totally disappointed 😒
13,A Google user,4 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,46,"I hate this game. I was the the last one left and then I was shooting at this other dude that was left with me, and There was so much lag! I could of won! Thanks a lot for ruining my gaming experience. You just lost a lot of people play pubg, and those other people that you just lost go for my friends and I. I'm not going to tell you to fix the game cuz I'm not playing anymore. You just lost a player that was in love with this game. Oh yeah, and graphics, they are TERRIBLE. So, u guys own me $."
14,dwaipayan samaddar,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,315,"the best game ever. for me. im not the best at it. have a job. have a wife. dont play very often. still always feels awesome to play it. real stress buster. realistic. too good to be true. not purchasing items does not make u weak, just not fancy. purchasing items gives you dress and skins for cars, guns, etc. awesome game without a doubt. best game for me. ever."
15,Matthew Hendrickson,21 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,138,"I play this game every once and awhile because I actually do think it is a great game, but there is a slight problem. The one week I decide that I have enough time to play the game, they ban me for having a 'cracked' download (I downloaded it straight from the Google Play Store). Asks me to reinstall and bans me for 2 months. I contact the customer service and get canned answers and absolutely ignored because of 'high ticket volume'. This type of treatment will lose players for sure."
16,Victor Gillerson,21 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,4425,needs more guns. everything is perfect. except for the fact that the bike does not have boost (it would be pretty awesome) the resident evil 2 mode is too hard. I LOVE IT!!! make it harder and this time... we gotta all survive without fighting each other. we can be a huge team of 50 or 60 people and survive. plz consider my suggestion (unless it won't work)
17,A Google user,23 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,108,"I love this game but now the new map is so difficult .In this new map we should kill enemies with zombies it is too hard. The zombies kill us . We can't play in this new zombie map. I feel hating this game. And now I'm feeling like ,'why did I updated this '. If you can remove this new map it is better to play. If it is not possible I'll uninstall this game."
18,Train Conductor,22 February 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,89,"honestly, the game's pretty good, it did a very good job in simply putting the pc experience and visuals onto the mobile platform, it's realistic very simple and strategic,etc. I don't play anymore. Why? A simple reason, it's boring. Despite all of the pros that i've included in this review the content of the games is simply too short to be enjoyable, it's the same thing again and again and not much to expect for the mext update making the game very boring once you play too much of it."
19,Yash krishn kumar,25 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,197,"This game is really awesome and all my friends love as much as I do. I even bought season 4 battle pass and it's really sad as I can't buy season 5 battle pass. But I will buy the season 6 battle pass. Today I opened a crate with coupon and a glitch happened and I got nothing but I got the daily achievement of ""TRY YOUR LUCK"". Please help me on this matter. Otherwise the game lit and I love playing it with my friends. Once I deleted this game for 20 days and when I installed it theygaveme gift😁"
20,Sandra Marie Torres,23 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,69,"This game has amazing graphics, great deals (if you got money to spend), and extremely addictive for every gamer! The only downside is the money, I dont have money to burn and when I like to upgrade something I can't. It's a big problem for me... 😓😓 Also I wouldve given this game 5 starts but when the event about google giving every user $1, I couldnt get it. I rate 4.5"
21,Mike Wasawsky,25 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,51,"Would be nice if the game would have a region restriction when joining a game, like that I don't have to play against gypsies from Arabia and Asia, every single match. Not to forget all the wall hackers and aim-boters (90% being Asians, also). Long story short, trash developing team, that just cares of how many people play the game, not how they play it."
22,prince shohag,11 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,10,"This is one of my best game, but there is a problem I think. In this game, there are some gamer, who always goed to offline mood, then come back. In your system, it takes restart the previous game. But they Don't play or don't help team-mates. So I wish, on the next version this system will remove, so that every player can give there best playing poewr on this game. Thank you for give us this beautiful game."

24,Something Serious T.V. #,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,52,Way too buggy to be at a playable level. Very poor performance even on a high end device. Update : Still no improvements from the development team. We cannot wait for small things to get fixed for weeks. Update 2 : Responsiveness is still bad. Servers are laggy Update 3 : I am giving up on this game. Update : still the shittiest optimized game on the planet
25,Dakota Obrian,22 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,93,"I love the game, and I love all of the updates that have been made to the game. however, the only suggestion I'd have is to keep survive until dawn. the game mode is lit. everyone I have talked to about it thinks that it should stay. this mode actually makes ur moble game unique to the other battle royale games in the app store. all in all great game and if ur reading this thank you for your time."
26,Angela Valeska Harijono,23 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,63,"well, this game is good and the graphic is very cool, but there is one reason i don't give 5 stars, it is because, i always get out of the game automaticly in the middle of the game and it's bothering me. I wanna enjoy my game then my phone start to blank and i get out of this game. i deleted all the games that take my storage and it won't work as well. i have a lot of storage to download this game but still... this game is error. plis fix thiss..."
27,jimmie muggy,25 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,90,"Fun and it works pretty well, but the audio is backwards when I'm not using headphones. If i flip the phone over and let the screen rotate, the audio flips, too. Fantastic with headphones, but I don't always want to use them and it's frustrating to die because you heard shooting on your left when it coming from your right."
28,A Google user,26 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1019,"it's a amazing game. I really like it and I really enjoying playing this game. when I bored i used to play this with my friend and if no friend then i just play solo. It's pretty fun game,someone who read this should download this game. The graphic is really cool, is the memory too big for your phone ? , better you uninstall some applications. Because this app is really cool,amaizing,and pretty fun.it's not just for boy, girls can play this too.okay, enough of my review hope if you inspired play"
29,A Google user,7 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,67,"This game is fun and enjoyable with one exception. It's full, and I mean full of cheaters. This is the mobile version made for cell phones and tablets, but you'll find and be killed by, players who use a keyboard and mouse. This gives them a big advantage in the game and spoils the fun for players who refuse to cheat. I recommend looking for a game that puts all the players on a more equal field, because PUBG Mobile isn't it."
30,Sarah Alinaa,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,41,"account banned without any reason. I never used pubg on pc but 2 days ago I purchased a laptop after login, I played a game. But after that, my account banned permanently (for about 10 years). I sent them a lot of messages, also on email but they always reply same message without read my message. I love a lot this game because this is not a game.... I'm sorry to rate 1 star."
31,A Google user,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1064,"Awesome graphics and gameplay. Servers had some problems but now that is somewhat fixed. However, if u face any problem, it is hard to get any assistance. I only wish for 3 things- 1. better customer support. 2. fix bugs/hacks. 3. I love the skins and clothing and often use money to purchase. But I am playing with a male character. About 7-8/10 times, I get female clothing and skins. Please fix drops depending on the current character. Also please make female/male version of skins from RP."
32,Leslie Sabu,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,60,"Neat. The game is fantastic. Except for the event. The Resident evil event is played by people the same as they do in classic. The moronic gameplay results in zombies winning with no fight. Guys, zombies are there. Team up with other players, at least for your own survival. The event is meant to be played co-op, not backstabbing each other."
33,SHAH QUADRI,19 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,59,"It is an amazing game ,but it is not working properly .I am really very angry of it, so plzzz try to fix the problem or I will delete this fantastic game. So ASAP just fix the game and reply me Dear developers. I have problem of voice chat and many more ok guys just improve it. I really want to play and dont want to delete this game but I'm a straight forward person. I can really uninstall it so just do it."
34,mehedi hasan,19 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,147,"after the latest update this game sucks. so many issues. now this game is more like other games. server issue sucks. lags to much in a good configuratrion device too. and the zombie version is for kids i think. what have they done to the game. it feels like they've just burned the face of a nice doll. old is gold. previous version was king and update is nothing but a business where there is nothing for users. if i could rate it below zero now, i would."
35,prodigal son,20 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,11534,very addictive! cant put it down. easy game and great graphics. I can play friends or people all over the world . the only thing I'd change is if your a guy you get guy stuff and if your a girl you get girl stuff. it would be nice if players or friends could trade what they have with eachother and if you buy something you should be able to keep it instead of it expiring. the cost is a little high also. if they changed those things then this game would be fire!
36,Logan Lansangan,20 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,59,"The app runs great on my phone. Love it so much that I went out and bought an RCA Voyager 3, (thinking that it would run it on an android 7.0 op system). The tablet runs the app, however I get a message saying that my device isnt supported. Please fix soon, if this is even fixable. If not, at least let me know. There isnt much out about this."
37,Aarya Dhutmal,21 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,184,"In every freaking match the server times out many a times and finally it asks me to restart the app, I mean EVERY FREAKING TIME. I have tried changing networks too but it still won't work. it makes me want to just give up on the game. Have been playing from the start too, huge disappointment. I have uninstalled and installed it a lot of times too, but this still happens. 😞😞 I would like it if this issue is looked into soon as possible."
38,Prasenjit Raj,26 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,202,"This game, to be honest is pretty good in every aspect. But there is only a tiny problem i face sometimes. That is about the match making. Well its okay to have a lobby with players from bronze 1 to gold 4 but i have been experiencing this recently that i'm being matchmaked with a player frm platinum or diamond and thats not fair . It happens sometimes so it isnt a big issue but if u guys can fix it , the game will literally be perfect for me."
39,DJ SPACEOUT,27 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,267,"Inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, the game has one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for gear to defend themselves from other players. They have the option of fighting alone (Solo), with another player (Duos), or with a team of three others (Squads). As time progresses, the playable area within the island gradually constricts to force encounters between players, until one player or team remains, thus ending the match. Experience earned from matches goes towards"
40,Arron Horn,12 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,128,"love this game. I've been playing it since the 2nd season and I find it the best game ever. I just have an issue with the weapon master achievement. I can't get it to tick anything. I played solo, duo and squad but still doesn't get any ticks and my rank is diamond 1. I should have completed it by now but I wish u guys just please fix that problem for me. thank you and keep making this game the best of everything"
41,Vijay Baidya,20 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,699,"What anti-cheat mechanism??? many players are cheating like YAMRAAJ, Shizuka, ContactMe.... there are many others. I got shots from three directions in open ground with invisible enemies. Many are reporting but they are still playing. If you are unable to find please watch and listen to their videos in YouTube how they are cheating. Although I like this game very much. Thanks to developers for this amazing game."
42,Arunav Dey,19 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,26192,"The game is great. Always my retreat at the end of the day. But one thing that annoys me (which is why I didn't give 5 stars) is that my phone is pretty powerful to run the game at Smooth and Extreme settings. But you have limited my maximum setting as Smooth with Medium frame rates. I play much heavy games on my phone at 60FPS. I fully believe my phone can run this game at extreme settings as well, hoping that you'd let me know if you're going to unlock this frame rate for my phone model."
43,snwahidah,19 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,580,"I am DISAPPOINTED with the updated ones. I don't care about seasons. Please, I WANT THE OLD PUBG. I AM A BIG FAN OF PUBG. PLEASEEEEEEEEEE. I hate everything about the updated ones. THAT IS NOT THE PUBG THAT I ONCE LOVE. You don't need those zombie. Please be ""PUBG"" not President Evil or whatever it is. I am sorry. But, I think I need to uninstall this game until the old version come back again. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED."

45,JustWannaPlayGames,22 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1251,The game was running really smooth before the update. But after the update it's stuttering so much and sometimes the screen freezes for a few seconds. It's also taking a lot of time for the buildings and terrain to load after landing... and NO it's not the internet.. I checked with my ISP and the problem is not from their side.. This has actually ruined the fun I used to get while playing the game... Hope you fix it ASAP.... (will change the rating after that）
46,Sayantan Sam Sarkar,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,6440,"Feb 19, 2019: The zombie mode is super fun. Kudos to tencent for always bringing in something new and interesting. Absolutely addictive with intense gameplay and the freedom to choose whatever tactics you feel like to get the job done. It's entertaining to see how so many different types of methods are employed by people to get that elusive chicken dinner. A real winner in my book."
47,Shubham rawat,9 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,1263,"I'm facing headphone issue. i can listen music and pick up calls everything is fine with the headphones but as soon as i open pubg, my headphones doesn't work. I've tried this with other headphones but the result is same. And before all this started there was another issue that whenever someone used to call me the headphones would disconnect and will not get connected unless i restart the game. From 5 stars to 2. That's pubg story."
48,Daniyal Ahmad,24 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,54,I've been playing it for a long while now and I have to say it's really good. Now there is a problem that arises whenever I start the game. On the first loading screen when it says starting pubg mobile the game closes all of a sudden and doesn't start. Also when the game used to run earlier I experienced many lags even when the ping was low.
49,Gareth Yang,19 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,8964,"Why is the button layout not optimized for phones with notch (P20 Pro, Mi 8)? After the update, some buttons on the menu screen are being overlapped by the notch and can't press them at all. It affects the gameplay drastically. Please fix this issue. Edit: After updating the new patch, it happens again. Can't the developer do something to fix this issue permanently?"
50,aison vidallon,24 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,12,"game is great and enjoyable overall, but I do have a problem with voice chat. It seems that my headset isn't the problem because I can hear the audio in-game. I can't chat using voice chat nor can I hear them even though I've enabled them in-game and in the app permission settings. There are times that they were fine, but broken after the next game. Devs, please help"

We tried and felt this game as the best game till now we had played. We heartily thank you for developing this game.We love this game so much that we cannot stop playing this game. We have to face Vietnamese and Indonasian players as we match in their server. So, we have a small request that your team needs to create a server in Nepal or match us in Indian Server. Since ,there are all"
52,William Walker,26 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,258,This game was once pretty awesome. Went through hell and high water to download the update and it is about as patchy and laggy as a game made by middle schoolers in the 80s. I'm seriously contemplating not playing anymore. Please fix whatever it is that was done to restore it to where it was before the forced update. Sheesh!
53,Grimmity Mobile Gaming,27 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,38,"They have banned my account without giving any reason. wont respond to my emails or in game request. Essentially they stole my money, my account, and my clan. Im livid, and that's an understatement. Why would you ban a legit top player and turn them into an F2P player?? I've given up hope but Id still gladly take my account back if I could."
54,Shreyas Kotkar,1 March 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,10,"An amazing game. however, needs some major improvements. 1. When you win with ""Chicken Dinner"", you get nothing! like practically nothing. some guaranteed costumes or weapons would make it interestingly competitive to win everytime. 2. Zombie mode was epic. however, it was laggy! and no major rewards after winning. 3. Coins? what is the point of coins? we cant do anything with it except the simplest crate with the most simple items. 4. Rooms with team 4v4 head on duel would be cool!"
55,Tejas Karve,28 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,57,i was reluctant to play this over hyped game for a long time and rigidly stood my ground. then i downloaded it just for trial and i am amazed to experience the charm. i really appreciate the development team and i can only imagine how hard you guys are working in the back end to keep up with growing community and its needs. May God bless this game with greater success...
56,A Google user,8 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,4,"very much lagging and in-between the game mode, sometimes getting the ""Server lost"" and have to restart the game to become normal. And also there is a problem of losing the voice chat between the team mates while playing sanhok map.....And also you should mention in the description that the game is only for High- end devices, not for middle/low-end devices."
57,Shaikh Danial Ali akhtar,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,11,Game is nice. But it worths 1 star because its full of bugs. Always lagging and voice in game is gone most of the time. It's been going on for a long time and developers don't really care about it I think. Otherwise they would've resolved the problem by now. I have uninstalled this beautiful game which is trash if it can't run smoothly
58,Honey Panwar,20 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,240,"The game is one of the best games out there but Tencent is making it much worse day by day. The game is full of cheaters , bugs and lagging like hell from the past two seasons. And after so many requests from all round the world Tencent gaming is unable to fix the frame drops and is not able to remove the hackers from the game resulting many are deleting the game. The game doesn't have any future the way thing are going with the pubg mobile community."
59,Charlie Xu,5 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,31,"I was wrongfully permanently banned a little more than a month ago. The worst of it is that I still don't even know why. I've messaged customer support dozens of times with detailed messages which provided proof of my innocence against multiple ways in which I could have been banned. I have not yet received a single, non-automated reply. I've never interacted with worse customer support, and in the process I lost thousands of hours of achievements and hundreds of dollars. Disheartening..."
60,Ath Lete,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,368,"Without this game, I was addicted to Social media and WhatsApp. I used to spend 2 to 3 hours in them. Now, because of this game I don't have a social life at all. And I play for half an hour, and later I study. This game actually saved my life and career. And BTW, please take care of the hackers. It's been an year and the hackers are still in the loose. I see a speed runner and I can't report without getting killed by them, which is kind of unfortunate."
61,Nadja Lee Torres,25 February 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,8,"Even tho the new update added the whole zombie thing, it's extremely glitchy. The game freezes or you hear loud beeps and eventually it kicks me out of the game. Edit: the game got worse after a small update within the game. It keeps glitching even more than before and I can barely play any match at all. I payed 10$ to gain the membership and I totally regret it because of all the glitches. Decided to uninstall in the end."
62,Ayantika Roy,27 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,56,"It's the best game anyone have ever played❤. I was really waiting for a Shooting Game like this for mobile, and then Pubg Mobile was introduced. I was really very curious about the game because of it's trailer and I'm swearing I am just loving it since the day I have downloaded this game. This Game deserves a rate of Infinity Stars and the Updates are making the game more exciting. Thanks for the mobile version 😘."
63,Edward Epright,28 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,32,"it took me hrs and hrs of game, no cheating. chalk up an occasional 31 but mostly 18 here 12 there. finally make it to crown tier, go into a game and shoot an opponent in the back with a full clip. this guy turns around and pops me one shot. what do I get, -40. This is why I will not put one dime into this game, I like everything about it but that one thing makes it worth a free app only."
64,Doom Shroom,28 February 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,40,"my fun and joy were shattered after encountering hackers. not one, but a whole team of them. one had a very long head and the other three was invisible. the only thing that was visible on them was their hair and pan. my friend fired a whole round of clip on the long-headed one but it didnt even knock him/her. i managed to knock one of the invisible one but i was immediately disconnected from the game and i couldnt re-enter."
65,Kenaz Lai,20 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,54,"A great game with amazing graphics, however, large stream of glitches. This is at three stars simply because after the new update, I'm unable to open the app, it would crash the moment the pubg title page loads. This used to happen every time I updated but usually it would fix itself in 5 mins, didnt happen this time. Would change rating if the response is on time. Edit: Glitches fixed and everything runs smooth for me now. Amazing job by the devs!"
66,Ayush Gaming,24 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1536,"Respected Tencent Games, Since pubg globally released in Nepal, we Nepalese people we eager to try the new game. We tried and felt this game as the best game till now we had played. We heartily thank you for developing this game.We love this game so much that we cannot stop playing this game. We have to face Vietnamese and Indonasian players as we match in their server. So, we have a small request that your team needs to create a server in Nepal or match us in Indian Server."
67,Pawan Bhandari,5 March 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,151,Very entertaining game. I love this game very much and lots of people of my country(Nepal) love this game and play widely. But we get worst ping of all. Its not so satisfying that people here love this game so much but high ping always ruins our enjoyment. So i request tencent to work on this area and care about all of your gamers. Thankyou for making such good game.

69,Maisum Walli,9 March 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,3,"Games I good, I would give it more stars BUT the new update messed up everything. I keep dieing in one or two bullets really!! with all that armor on me seriously are u kidding me. And don't get me started on the door. I have to keep opening them even when I set the doors to auto open. Also can't find the voice tag ""I got supplies"", used to help when play with friends. Im disappointed. My game time has dropped since rhis new update slowly missing the patience to enjoy this game."
70,andrew jordan,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,371,"I've been at since its release in march 2018. Yes, I'm just now rating.. but still hooked!! and probably always will be! Thank you for maintaining a perfect gaming experience, never ending suprises in each update, while keeping the idea of good old fashion war in mind without getting to futuristic, or unrealistic. And last buy not least.. Thanks for Zombie mode!! I dont even play on my console, I get the PUBG experience at the tip of my fingers every I go. Thanks team! keep up the excellent work"
71,Devil May Cry,1 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,40,"This game is really fun. Normally I'm not into shooters but this game is awesome! I love taking on other players from around the world. I also think its cool whenever you're killed it shows you the location of your killer and even gives you a spectate option, I've learn alot from that. And now I get to take on Zombies, Lickers, Mr X, and now William Birkin (G Monster)! PUBG X Resident Evil 2!"
72,S S,19 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,87,"Before I found this game my wife and I were on the verge of divorce. After I started playing almost a year ago, my wife asked me why I was always on my phone. She thought I was chatting with another woman. I told her that as usual she was wrong and that I had discovered this awesome game. After showing it to her she downloaded it. Now thanks to PUBG we are a happy couple and finnaly have somthing in commun. We haven't had a fight since thanks PUBG👍🏻"
73,A Google user,20 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1303,"This game is one of the BEST if not, the BEST mobile shooting games. The graphics are amazing, it's challenging, and a great time killer! Plus the updates always exceed my expectations with new and fun content. As a matter of fact, why are you still reading this review? Quit wasting time, and go download this game if you have the space."
74,Tahmid Rohan,20 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1418,Great time pass game. Very addicting. But some players are using hacks that is a matter of thought. Some players turn on the mic and play music which is disturbing. I am loving the new update. Please make the zombie mode permanent in arcade its a fan request. Loved that when I report a player you guys respond immedietly. Some player are using the green skin mod hack. You will see that in youtube. Pls take care of that. Keep up the good work.
75,makoto iriya,22 February 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,5,"The new update has some issues that needs to be fixed Sir/Ma'am. First, it became so lag. Second, the door won't automatically open (even if it says auto) . Third, my screen freezes at the middle of the game even though it was okay at first. Fourth, my screen suddenly went black and I need to forcibly turned off my phone to get back again. (Sometimes the game became choppy) My gameplay from both of my phone was okay before the update. tHo I still like the game it just crashed sometimes."
76,Nikhil Tiwari,1 March 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,4,"In my opinion, it's the best mobile game I've ever played. Still, this game has the same problems as others. After each update bugs are increasing with size of game file. The latest problem I've experienced is that players can not use the classic voice to mark enemies ahead and I got supplies. Also, the in game ping is increasing with each update, especially the ping is always high in vikendi map. I've completed surveys twice regarding pubg mobiles experience but didn't got coupon scrap reward."
77,Jaggu Rox,23 February 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,14,"It is by far the best multiplayer game ive ever played but after the new update, its lagging... soon after the game is over and we go to the lobby.... while loading, it gets stuck and necer moves forward.. i will have to restart the game again for it to function. if u fix this, theres no prob. And please do keep the zombie as a fixed mode and not just a event. Cheers"
78,Hetal Thacker,24 February 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,205,"this game is too good ,I like this game and the graphics is superb the game is too likely to me and my all friends and brothers. By playing this game we get knowledge of guns. this is too good for time spending. In this game a Miramar map is not that much good and another one thing is that we should have to download the maps that is also not good. From all the I like only 3 three maps that is erangel,sanhok and vikeindi map is too good but Miramar is not good. The pubg mobile is best game"
