0,Sanket Kamble,8 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1034,"'Payment Assist' feature is not turning off even after making it off through settings. I don't understand why don't you look after these bugs. What is happening? First, I was given an option 'Payment Limits' and set the limit. Now when I want to update the limits, it says 'No payment type supported'. Please help me. This is not acceptable. And yes you are not fixing bugs, instead you are adding more."
1,Niharika Bhatnagar,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,19,"This is ridiculous I have already done my kyc and still I haven't been able to use my wallet im having to shift to other apps that I don't want to use because paytm won't allow me to use it even after completed my kyc procedure. How are you not losing customers like this? I tried to raise the issue but it's not even possible to register a ticket for this, its ridiculous, how am I supposed to solve this issue."
2,shubham billus,7 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,45,"Try as much as you want to contact the helpline. They will either not help you at all, or worse dont even respond to your chat on so-called 24/7 helpline. Used to love paytm, but now it is just an app to scam people and then they become unavailable when it comes to reporting these scams. Be it call helpline, in-app chat helpline or emails. Worst app possible. #SayNoToScams"
3,Doreen Fernandes,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,138,I want to uninstall the app and have no more dealings with Paytm as I am unable to use my balance payment to pay. They are insisting on the KYC process but in spite of several complaints my issue has not been resolved. They keep sending me useless links which do not work. They have responded with a link to their helpline but the issue remains unresolved.
4,Rahul KR,9 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,16,"slow slow slow. Have to wait very long time for the first startup and initiate payment. The shop owner gives me a look as if am using an outdated device. With Android Oreo and 6GB RAM on the device, if you can't optimize, why not a lite version? Why do i have to put up with a terrible user experience?"
5,Koihei Hauz,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,40,paytm is good honestly speaking. but paytm mall is not good at all.

7,Prajul Vishnu,8 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3,"Hell with your service and customer care executive. It takes 5 mins to connect a call and another 5 mins for your response and in between some bloody music being played ðŸ˜–. Even without using coupon it shows ""offer is valid only for one time usage per user"" What the hell? Totally fooling the customers."
8,gattu venkatesh,7 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,7,"I like PayTM and using actively from last 4yrs. Bought PayTM first. When i bought it showed ""unlimited and free shipping from Paytm mall"" now all of a sudden without any intimation it is changed to ""priority shipping on Paytm mall"". Even this priority shipping doesn't seems genuine. I have PayTM first subscription and my wife doesn't have it. I see same expected delivery date on both accounts for all products i saw. This is cheating in the name of loyalty program and not being loyal by themselves"
9,Manish Wadhe,9 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,21,"worst app i lost my 1270 Rupees, during a unsuccessful transaction, i tried calling several time to paytm, but cant connect to the customer care executive, i also have sent them email but got no reply. worst experience ever, i will not recommend this app to any one , please use your own bank app for transaction, its safe and secure at least bank has there call center support executive appointed to resolve the issue of the customers."
10,Mohan Durga Prasad,10 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,148,I have tried to recharge on paytm and selected number from recent list and clicked on proceed. After selected it has done payment thru wallet immediately. This is happened only because of automatic selection of fast forward default selected. Pls remove this automatic selected.

16,Tajinder Singh,7 March 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,66,"Font toooooo small. Else App is great overall. Search options (under Mall tab) does not give correct returns sometimes. Filters also does not apply correctly sometimes. Also, you cannot edit the search after the results are shown. You need to re-type it."
17,Madhu Badisha,7 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,24,"Paytm is getting worst with every update.After the recent update, the default payment option is not working. Even after selecting the default bank account to transfer the money, the app shows a non default bank account for payment at the time of transaction."
18,A Google user,7 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,124,i have paid more than seven electricity bills above rs 2000/- through your app. a massage was flashing on my phone that you are only one transaction away for receiving rs 700/- as cash back . i have not received any amt from paytm. may i know the reason?
19,Bilal Dar,7 March 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,21,There is a problem with the new version. Every time we need to select a the remitter account for carrying out UPI transaction. There is no benefit of selecting a default account account in case of multiple accounts. Please rectify it.
20,yusuf kushurian,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,109,"Worst service, no one picks paytm mall number. It always says executives are busy with other customers. No reply to messages sent to paytm. Moreover, returns are not picked up on time, pickup boy always marks it as failed without even trying."
21,Pankaj Tirpude,8 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,202,"Whenever I try to make some urgent transaction, it always doesn't work. The app either crashes or it makes transaction unsuccessful. But when there is time to add money in wallet it runs faster. That's not fair Paytm."
22,Abhishek Bandyopadhyay,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,21,"Super laggy and buggy. Most of the time, the scan and pay option will freeze. Hate to see such a downfall for this app. I was quite hooked into the platform when their KYC policy started bothering me up. Without the KYC done, you can't use the wallet which is fine by Govt. Norms. But they don't have a in app KYC uploading policy or they have good KYC points. They claim that the KYC can be done freely but all of their KYC points charge 20 bucks for the process. Super pathetic customer support."
23,gokul vidyardhi chadaram,9 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,"Because of this app I may have lost Rs.790. I sent money through paytm to other person my account got debited but he didn't get the money, after this I had to pay in cash, the sad part is I tried to contact customer care and was on the chat for 30 mins and hadn't received any response from paytm, I am never using this app again."
24,Sunil Reddy,9 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,I was one of the initial customers who started using Paytm and I loved the Cashless experience. But the latest KYC experience made me get out of Paytm service and I made them refund my money and close the wallet account. I completed KYC at a nearby store by paying Rs 30 and he told me everything is good. But after few days got a message from Paytm saying the documents uploaded are not clearly visible and asked me to again to get the KYC done. So decided to stop using their wallet. Disappointed.
25,Pritam Nirmal,9 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,56,very useless app shows 100% cash back but never gives a single rupee back very frustrating and you dont have my query (question) mantioned in your 24Ã—7 section that is more frustrating even you dont deserve 1 star. very bad service i told you you dont have my question mentioned in your 24Ã—7 section and you still sending me link of 24Ã—7
26,Dhanesh Kamal,7 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,13,Very bad in offers. they say offers given when transaction happens but doesnt gets delivered. you raise tickets and you get the poorest replies ever seen in history of resolving issues. you raise another ticket on another issue and same thing happens. hats off!!
27,Aman Ankit,1 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,132,"After using it for 2 years, i am feeling that support of this application is literally bad. if a service is provided to a customer, then its the providers responsibility to make sure customer is happy, but it seems now paytm has grown big but customer satisfaction has been thrown out of the concept. From my side i will never recommend anyone this services. If anyone of you are having issues in understanding then please try reaching the support, hope you will get a better experience."
28,Junaid Mohsin,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,5,I've been requesting from last 5 days to delete my paytm account but everytime I get a revert that please confirm that you want to delete the account and it's associated services and I've replied 4 times with the confirmation and still customer services are not taking any initial step...This is most pathetic customer services that I've ever dealt with...
29,Rahul,9 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,352,Started using paytm almost after a year due to Aadhar and Privacy issues. Increasing my rating to 5 from earlier 3. The app has become a perfect digital solution to almost everything. I just hope that user privacy stays at the top of their priority.
30,A Google user,9 March 2019,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,1060,Using Paytm for last few years...Disappointed with Customer Service issues.....Even KYC issues are not handled appropriately...Serious interospection...

31,Sreeman Sri,8 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,"I had a problem in my login issue. It has been blocked and i would like to open the account but no proper reply from paytm servers.

32,Ajay Pratap Singh,8 March 2019,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,96,There was a issue related to payment and it got resolved. Thanx for the great services and quick response. I love the app as it is all in one app whether to shop or to make transactions or payments.
33,A Google user,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,"Used to be good. Currently not even allowing to recharge even though have sufficient paytm balance. The app shows paytm balance as '0' during checkout while passbook shows balance. The website shows payment failed system error. The 24x7 help button is of no help. Can't raise a query on web or app. Just stating retry. Called cust. care no. provided in app, which provided another no. which is always busy. Money is stuck in paytm wallet. Can't use it either."

36,Banibrata Dutta,11 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,3,"When it works, it works. Updates and some other obscure cases sometimes wipeout login information and you need to do through some painful relogin procedure. Works decent only on WiFi and good 4G coverage, but not so well in slow mobile data. Also their full KYC mandate is such a royal pain in the rear end. Why must one travel 6kms away in crazy traffic for in-person full KYC to be told that the centre doesn't do the personal KYC anymore. Switched to Google Pay."
37,himanshu sharma,11 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,"Such a useless app they are not giving the KYC error when you are adding money to your PAYTM wallet, but when you are trying to use your own added money from wallet then they will show you the error your KYC. is not done. Its better you should show all rules and regulations when someone is adding money instead of cheating him once money is added."
38,Garvit Khandelwal,10 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,9,I bought a movie ticket on which they sold me a cancellation protect which was automatically selected and was add to my movie ticket fee Now I will never book my ticket from paytm and other also do it on your risk.

43,A Google user,10 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,4,I simply don't understand how a perfect app can become buggy. The developer are fools. Edit: The developer of this app is really fool. Why you can't read my problem here???
44,Dhiraj Kumar,3 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,46,"No customer service is available through call, only fake description is their about in application. but no response from customer care number. Also if you raise a complain, they simply didn't read what customers are saying , they are just putting a parrot like statement, I think PayTm think, there employee as a parrot, they use cop,paste line reply on any complain."
45,gpraveen kumar,8 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,15,"* customer care 24/7 is worst. * Taking too much of time to solve the problems. * Better to use Airtel payments banks, IPPB. * My sincere request dont use paytm, i raised my query 1 month back still not solved my issue. * paytm India worst payment bank."

57,Chaitanya Maheshwari,9 March 2019,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,16,"Great app. Making our lives easy, cashless and filled with cashbacks. But, all is fine until you encounter a problem. After you encounter a problem, good luck with the support staff. Paytm customer support is the worst. They keep sending automated messages, that too after long delays, without any relevant solution, and after sometime, even don't care for automated messages, and the issue is never resolved."

I was supposed to pay my Spectranet broadband bill of. amount 2946 and had debited 2942 from my Canara Bank account as i had 4 rupees in my wallet already. But Paytm deducted 5884 from my account on its own at the intervel of 1minute which is very odd as i did not request for the amount of 2942 second time. I have paid the bill successfully bit I should have the remaining amount that is 5884 minus the 2942 still in my wallet.

76,Himalayan Drifters,26 February 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,824,Pathetic App and Dumb Services In spite of all the features this dumb app never works when you are paying facing major issues using Paytm Bank and Wallet as well as app crashes 10 times before I make any payment. Customer care gave us 20 mins waiting on hold but came up with no solution. Google Pay is way better.
77,Aap Kkok,5 March 2019,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,24,Paytm is a fraud company.. Their application says 24 hours customer service but their is no live operater to talk... They take UR money and keep in to their account and when u want to use it than they will give you an excuse for rejecting... YOUR KYC IS NOT UPDATED... only when u want to make a payment not the time when u deposite money.... Please please don't do the business with paytm..
