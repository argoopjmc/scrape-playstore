0,Rahul Raghav,"January 28, 2019",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,4089,"Its a good app without any advertisement as even official railway apps contain many advertisements. But few updates back the the app stopped saving PNR, previously it used to save pnrs and even show notification whenever there is a change in status and even on day of travel it showed that you have train today, which is on time or not. Being in protocol we have to deal with 100 of PNRs daily and automatically saving was very useful. If they can bring back this feature i can give my five stars back"
1,Bijesh Krishnankutty,"January 28, 2019",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,358,"Just superb. This app has a very user friendly interface. Always wished this kind of tracking and display system inside each compartment. Anyways now it's in our palm. Nowadays while traveling in night, I don't need to peep outside for checking the station. A big thanks to the team. Changing to 2 star, as all good features are removed from the app. Its diverting to a different site for even PNR update. Looks like intentionally killing this app for benifitting some other."
2,Ameya Maharana,"March 1, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,109,"The app is good, but needs more improvement. Many time it gives wrong information which missleads the user. Train accuracy is not that great as expected. Earlier we use to see the available seats in this app itself but now its redirected to the indian railway site which takes lots of time to get the details. The old version was very user friendly and provided all the information like pnr and seat availability etc. Hope to see improvement in the app and also experience like the older one."
3,Astitva Srivastava,"January 20, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,8213,Salute to the developers of this app. üôèüôå This is the best railways tracking app I have seen ever. It is an awesome idea to take data from people and serve millions of people with exact and accurate information about train status rather than depending on railway stations. Hence it also works when NTES server stops working. I also liked how it reads sms to get PNR details with coach sequence and seat location. Speedometer thing is another awesome idea. Everything is awesome! Thanks developers. üòä
4,Sitadevi Muthkhod,"March 7, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,44,"Very accurate n instantly updated without internet when in train. Best app for trackin express trains. I've personally recommended this to my friends. The alarm feature n platform no. comes handy. There's intermediate stations n travelled distance as well. The estimated time of arrival n departure for each station is very helpful, especially when travelling by trains without a pantry car, so you know when to get down without having to miss the train :) And the most important part- No Ads!"
5,Jayanth Jayaprakash,"January 20, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1519,"Excellent live train location app. Sharing of your train location ( while you are in train ) is very useful. It helps your friend or parents or loved ones or your driver to reach the station only at the time of actual arrival. They can use the time for other important work instead of wasting time in waiting at the railway station. Wish the developers extend this useful service to bus, mmts, local trains and metro trains. As these services are highly unpredictable and no live update. cheers üëç"
6,A Google user,"January 29, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,290,"I was a regular user of NTES. Of late I realised that NTES doesn't give accurate information on train arrival/departure. After I shifted to Where is my train, the timings are bang on right!! it's so accurate that I can plan my journey down to a minute. Congrats to the team behind the app and all the best. It would be great if the app could give info regarding cancelled/diverted/delayed trains as well. Also a cleaner interface giving details of trains between two stations would be nice :)"
7,Ahamed Abdul Rahman,"January 14, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,517,"Amazing app. Keep up the good work. One suggestion. You might get user permission and read message inbox/mail inbox for upcoming journeys and alert user on that day. Edit1: After the latest update, the PNR status is opening in Railways webapp. Earlier, it was not the case where the pnr status is sown in the app itself. can you please restore that old functionality. So giving 4 stars."
8,A Google user,"March 9, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,26,Early it was good but now day by day detoriates and train running status timing not updated even the train reach the destination station the old version is very accurate and give correct information user friendly. In general all the apps get improvement but this app is reversing get detoriates once again I rate the app 1 star very worst. but for old version give 5 star and extremely good

10,Indrajit Neogi,"January 19, 2019",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,229,"One of the best app ever what NTES couldn't this app and adding tracking using cell tower is a very innovative step.. Hats off. I HAVE CHANGED IT TO TWO STARS, PLEASE FIX THE WAY EARLIER WE USED TO VIEW SEATS AS NOW IT MOVES TO A DIFFERENT INTERFACE WHERE ITS NOT EASY TO BROWSE, when we look for seats"
11,Rajiv Daga,"January 27, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,108,A simple and beautiful app. I wish they had just 2 more options and it would be a perfect app. 1) Option to sync so that if we change the phone the data is still backed up. 2) When it redirects to the IRCTC website and there is a math question there are other apps which gives a popup with the answer but it is missing in this app.
12,Anirudh Madiq,"February 16, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,65,Awesome app. One of the best app for Indian railways. Live tracking of train is accurate and no ads is a bonus. Kudos to the creators... Well done.. update: after the update.. the pnr status checking is very difficult. please revert it back to original one. earlier i gave it 5 stars but now due to pnr checking mishap I'll give it 3 stars.
13,A Google user,"March 6, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,20,Friends this is very important and faster aap rather then any other train app. In my advice you will you will find your life very easy and faster. But I have a suggestion for the aap that they should fill up the platform no because we can not trust on everyone and this app doesn't show the location of every local and passenger train.
14,Karthikpandian Kanagathiruvengadam,"January 18, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,194,"Usefull app, its helps wake up spot locations arrival time and crossing trains etc. Better take next step can book the local train tickets will usefull for every one. speed meter calculation good. Delay time reasons not updated try to update its usefull to all. PNR ststus need to go another link recent days."
15,samir das,"February 15, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,103,"You guys did a great by creating this one. Hassle-free experience we indians are enjoying. In one word this is fantabulous. But there is a but. Cell tower is not working properly. Kindly do something. You guys are definitely know the situation of our beloved own country, India's internet problem.

16,Kevin John,"February 9, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,133,I am a frequent long time user of this app.I am very much satisfied with this app till today. But today the app shows the real face and lost my one and half hour. It's shows that a train is just arriving and actually the train get canceled. There is no other way for me to reach my destination in this night time and I have to wait for next passenger train that comes after one and half hour
17,A Google user,"February 3, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,66,"This is one of the good app. but need to resolve many issues like sometime it show wrong info, and users are diverted acc to this app info. such as train not stand stn it show ""train arrived"" and second one is platform information show wrong.kindly request please be update always correct info .coz your correct info will be help to pick train without confuse and fail .and correct info will be highly recomended to away to use and follow for everyones. thanks."
18,CHANDAN KUMAR SINGH,"February 20, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,49,Love to use this app. Nice interface easy access to the required services. I have started using it for not very long but am loving it. Informations are to the point and actual. One thing I'd like to say haven't you guys listed new The Vande Bharat Express (Train 18).???
19,A Google user,"January 28, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,5162,"Old app was sorking nice but after update is it is very difficult to pnr check and save pnr. old version was very good. for old version I will give 5 star for new I will give only 2 star , Before update It was exceptional and excellent but after update It is working like so many other apps working. so why user waste time to check pnr status."
20,Naveen Narra,"February 5, 2019",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,57,The latest version of the app has many features which are broken in Android. For example: 1) The PNR Status refresh button in the App is going to the IRCTC passenger status enquiry screen requiring a CAPTHCA question and still not updating the reservation with the latest information which was not the case with the earlier app version. 2) The Ability to manually enter a PNR is also not working in the new app version as the IRCTC sms messages don't always come to recognize new bookings . The same feature works seamlessly in the Railyatri Android App but I prefer Whereismytrain App due to its enhanced user experience and app features. This app deserves a 5 star rating if the above issues are fixed.
21,Mubasshir Khumusi,"February 12, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,256,It is getting worst update by update. Precious version was awesome. This new feature of diverting it to NTES website is useless and just a waste of time. Useless capcha questions are irritating. Reshifting app to previous features will only go through else this version is useless. Is these changes done intentionally to promote different app? As the developers are degrading app with this new useless features. Revert app and avtive all the old features.
22,Manoj Neeli,"January 14, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,345,After updating app it is somewhat difficult to check PNR status it is directly take me 2 railway enquiry page. according to me the old one was so nice for checking PNR and also it saves PNR STATUS until we board into train when tctks confirms and no of times i showed those status for TC. so finally i m concluding that old one is good nd bettr than new updared app
23,nityanand pandey,"January 23, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,123,"Earlier, seats bw two stations would provide a table giving all the info of trains and two classes in a single screen. Now that feature has been changed to replicate the boring and very non user friendly way of revamped features of irctc website. Another problem now is , earlier actual timings of yrains for the last 1 month to 2 months could be observed. Now only 1 to 2 days data can be found for non terminating stations. That is bad. 1 month data of timings provide nature of the delays which is"
24,Rahul Mehra,"January 13, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,183,Train no. 18804 Hasedo express is not yet departed from raipur but still it is showing that it has crossed tilda.This has created a lot of confusion due to which many problems were faced. I have been using this app since months but this was not expected from you. I dont think so this is a recommendable app as it is already pre programmed and not showing the live status.
25,Devasheesh Pandav,"February 5, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,97,hey guys I don't know what to say but believe me what a stupendofantabulouslyfantastical app you've made. It gives accurate updates like you're directly connected with the loco pilots that thay told you the exact place where are they right now. Thanks for developing such a great app.
26,Sudersanan Ponathil,"February 10, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,37,An essential application everyone should have during journey. Thank you for this wonderful app. Checking PNR status is a tedious process and also coach position is sometimes inaccurate . The team need to work on this. I am giving 5 star for the accurate location update it provides during the entire course of journey.
27,Sai Reddy,"March 10, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,3,this App is mostly helpful to determine at where is my train for time management. it is fully helpful that what is traveling of train machanism by station by station in a interval of time. it must be requires Many terms of New updates for comes into Trending. one thing i suggest to this service operator that you must give actual information about train why because I suggest like that you told the train is Departed from particular station as train crossed into the total platform of the station
28,TANMAY DEY,"February 24, 2019",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,263,"Previous version was much useful. Loved that one. But the new version is really annoying. Linked to the Indian Railway website NTES..!! Was it necessary..? Unnecessary calculations and Hazard..!! Taking much time and operation isn't easy like before. If you redirect us to the NTES, why wouldn't we directly go to the NTES site in spite of using this app. Very disappointed with the new version.. I dislike this one.üëéüëé"
29,K S Sanish,"February 18, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,32,It's really a helpful app and it's better than all other apps I have seen. it does not show all updates of daily local trains in Mumbai. however for all express train time and spot by spot update is correct. I stopped all other apps after using this. it's feature of working even without Internet is cool.
30,Jayant Kumar,"January 22, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,66,After Google acquired this app I thought processing on this app will be very responsive and better than what it was previously. But I feel it down graded such a beautiful app by linking it to other website. If possible do search in the app itself rather than connecting it to any other. I really feel pity that the app being aquired by Google got degraded rather than upgrading Now i really hate to use this app except for the live train running status.
31,Deepak Varshney,"March 7, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1,"It is good App, but If train is diverted 2 or more than 2 stations and after diversion it has to reach next further station then it does not show the image of train and reaching time on that station, while I searched on google I came to know it from other sites. I have noticed it two times recently. Yesterday the same experience I had in 11058 train on 06.03.19. This train was diverted between Amritsar and Beas but it had to reach at Jalandhar city, but it is not showing train image and time."
32,Venkadesan N,"January 12, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,178,Very good app for tracking. Review of particular train may be implemented especially for punctuality of a train. So that definitely there would be chance of improvement as this app is used by most of the general public. Some trains like 16130 is frequently getting delayed in this route. Like that some more routes may also be there. This data is limited shown to public. Until unless it's get shared among the general public railway may not understand about general public's inconvenience.
33,Shwdeep SK,"February 22, 2019",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,10,"When we try to check Seat availability, to routes to a different page that says-Indian Railway Enquiry & we r unable to input anything there to check seat. also for the ""class"" & ""quota"", there is no option to select ""All class or Any"". Among the tabs- Spot, PNR & Seat, Spot & PNR are good.. But it wud be great if we cud use the ""Seat"" tab to check seats & book as well.."
34,Gayatri Kashyap,"February 26, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,20,"Classic example of how the Government machinery works. Older version was quite good and there was hardly any scope of changes, but all SARKARI BABOOs make it one of the worst app. You need to keep a calculator with you for any and every query. PNR, Spot train, reservation etc. all features are very time consuming and most irritating. Congratulation to all SARKARI BABOOs who designed such apps. Keep it up......"
35,Kalyani -,"February 11, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,136,"It was good but new update is worst, it asks every time to answer calculations, for PNR, seat checking everything. You should understand that we do not have free time to give answer of stupid numbers. Of we have so we will use laptop not mobile app. Time consuming now gonna uninstall it."
36,Zubin Divecha,"January 25, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,70,reliable and easy to navigate ui helps u all the more better. timings are updated. inside train feature is really helpful.. integrated with mumbai/delhi local train timings too. just all that u can ask for. pnr status and reservation integrations are laggy but for regular commuter like me. its time saver
37,Guru Prasad,"February 10, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,41,"it's a worst app.. need to improve more.. it's not showing any train loation properly.. before 30 min from any middle pick point, it always say that train not yet started and waiting for location to update... so it's a waste app.. if any train need to start from first point it will to train already in middle between two pick point and waiting for location update... so waste of using this app..."
38,A Google user,"February 23, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,9,"It's very helpful to keep us updated.

40,Priyanka Das,"January 25, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,70,"This is an awesome app, even the station staff use this app over irctc to update the train timings on the board. The only two problems are the alarm for the upcoming stations doesn't work properly, it rings on the expected as well as actual time and there is no option to save the pnr which was available before. Otherwise train timing accuracy almost 98%."
41,naresh kharat,"January 15, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,111,amazing and must have app for train commuters. i would suggest a feature to introduce info about the crossing train. for e.g. if my train stops at Station X and another non stop train crosses or pass by then inform the user about the passing train. that would be of great help. thanks alot team. i hope this will reach to you as a suggestion. kudos
42,R. F. Tushar,"January 25, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,37,Amazing app... Best app for all types of train enquiry.

Now i m giving you 5 star Toady. And i have one suggestion aslo for this application. Indian long route Trains mostly aprox 2-3-4-6 hours late so i m giving you my feedback. It's my thinking also. Kindly Please don't remove timing from the last and lasts stations because when we seen departure from the last stations we will think that Driver is good or covered my journey fastly and before with t

Besides it lets me know my seat, coach location and platform number, all in one app. I do not hesitate in giving 5 stars to this app."
45,Prasenjit Ghosh,"January 15, 2019",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,51,"Using this app since it's birth, now it's grown large! Everything was working fine until last few updates came out. Functions like checking seat availability or checking PNR status not working like charm anymore. It's causing nuisance, specially the checking of seat availability, while checking it's connecting to IRE which isn't responding with the request. Why do you need to come with such annoying update?!!"
46,A Google user,"February 28, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,145,"Changing 5 star to 1. till last month this app was doing excellent. now unable to check current PNR status and seat availability. App redirecting to NTES page. I m not sure is there any API restrictions is there or not. Also don't know Google acquisition has anything to do with this. I don't know that has anything to do with this. Now no use for me other that offline navigation on train. I had asked these questions in app feedback, but no reply came. very bad it is going."

It is 4 hours late to start form the origin and will only start by 5.15pm.. 12617 on 9th Feb. It's already showing arrived at tissur at 5.15pm. Uninstalling the app as it's misleading. For some time until I reached my station I was worried. I have been using this app for tracking my train as I am a regular commuter.
48,Sandeep Kumar,"March 9, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,2,A Very useful and highly recommend app. Indian railways should take a lesson from this app. Many times indian railways official train tracking site goes down or it is not updated regularly. This app saves passengers from problem faced during those time. It deserves more than 5 stars.

50,Mainak Nandi,"February 15, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,16,"Where is my train - app is one of the best concept apps ever for Indian common travelers. Railways are always on delay but passengers like to be aware of the position of the train or the approximate time. Hence this app is always helpful . This gives exact position of the train and tracks by kilometres even when you don't have GPS switched on . In that case, you have to be inside the train ofcourse. one of the best apps , especially for Indian railways."
51,Mahantesh Guruvinamath,"January 18, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,45,"App is good for train enquiry. but only problem is to check the seat availability.

I trusted you and now i am paying the cost.

In this case we can directly go to indian railways site.. Y we need to use this app? day by day it's becoming too worst.
60,pradeep kumar,"January 29, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,19,This is a great app for providing info on trains.... the previous version showed the seat availability and now its redirecting to another site which is completely frustrating. i have given 5 stars previously and now I'm giving only 1 star because of this.

62,Niranjan J,"February 19, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,18,excellent app. gives precise data of the location of trains. Alarm feature to wake you up just before the arrival of your destination is the best. can sleep peacefully and need not worry if the train is late or running in right time. the app tracks the location and gives wake up call accordingly. suoerb. keep it up.
63,A Google user,"March 4, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,1,In early times it was a tiresome job for me like travellors to find the status of the train before boarding for proper time management . Also to know where we reached when we are inside the train especially during night .When we are in AC compartment and during night totally we are unaware of the train reaching station unless we have to go outside .This useful App help to solve such inconveniences. Also food order posdibility is a good option. Thanks for the very useful App.
64,Bikash Nayak,"January 28, 2019",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,17,Sad to say older version was much better. Stupid update sabotaged it. In cell tower mode sometimes it does not update the present station unless I change it to Internet mode. Also it doesn't update the station on notification bar. Also it doesn't sets to cell tower mode easily as before. Now I have to 1st start with Internet mode and then change it to cell tower mode.

66,A Google user,"January 25, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,15,"Option to store the searched pnr restored, which is good. checking seat availability option still need to restored. if that done again this app will be favourite one. Befoe update app was good, only drawback noticed by me is not showing intermediate tains between stations. Expecting better updates"
67,Venkatraman Mahadevan,"March 1, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,4,"11014 of 1-March-2019, Poorly updated. The train is near GBD at 6:15 pm but WMT somehow believes it is still not left KSR. Finally by 6:20 it catches up after nearly 2 hours.!! This app was good. Some how they seem to be lax now."
68,A Google user,"February 1, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,21,nice app to find my train. But the older version is better than it. This version is not too good to chek my PNR status and seat ability. So I give it 4 stars . I want to get the previous version if I can. Also want to get the details of cancelled and diverted trains rightly.
69,Shaik Irfan,"January 20, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,31,"sorry this app became very worst the old version was good to access very easily and it was very convenient. Now the updated version is very hard to handle for everytime its asking cpatcha and we have to click for all types of services like 2A, 3A, SL. I dont know what are the disadvantages of the old version. Please bring back old version. Please it was the only good app to use."
70,Niks c,"February 17, 2019",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,2,Now this app is not good as earlier.. few things are become more complicated (pnr status) and bugs are increasing. even after reporting bugs are still remaining for many months.. means nobody is attending these issues..
71,Sindhu Pachipala,"January 25, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,15,"before it used to show trains and seats directly with percentage. but recently they are asking captcha and coming like as irctc website. it's somewhat difficult in phones. if this app also shows like irctc website, what is the use of having this app???"
72,Sailesh Pokhriyal,"March 5, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,2,"As a Mumbaikar, born and brought up, I have always had problems with local and express trains about the timings and which stop is next. This app makes it easy for your travels and to keep track of the trains you need to such as when relatives are about to arrive. Exact location is provided by this app and is updated every second or whenever you want."

75,A Google user,"January 19, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,24,its old version was best but this time update version worst. Because old version show direct show all train seat fare without any train no. But new version waste of time because if i check seat availaibility in train it direct open indian railway site cris.after that you give different different train and many information and it show one by one train seat availaibility so i think old version best and new version waste of time.so i give only one star. if you add old feature then i give you 5 star.
76,HelloAbhi,"February 1, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,10,"This app is simple yet amazingly accurate. It helps a lot to determine which station my train is approaching without looking through windows , usually when your seat is in upper birth. The best thing is it can find out current location without internet also using cell tower."
77,Showkathali TH,"February 6, 2019",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,4,"It's My favourite App before 2/3 updates back. But now a days it's a little bit irritating when we search PNR Status and Seat availability it open the page of Indian railways. ""If the searching of an app which not give results within it and always leads to another website it's called search engine."" Then why we don't have to enter directly into that website, why we are wasting the device space by installing the app."
