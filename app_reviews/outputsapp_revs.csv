0,Sagar Raj,11 March 2019,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,13,"The virtual chat bot is a health hazard if you are at risk for heart attacks or are susceptible to high blood pressure. It tests your patience to a great extent and there is seemingly no way to bypass the bot. Although digibank claims there is some way, best of luck finding it. Also no real incentives of using digibank over the payment wallets."

Finally you should integrate the digibucks program in the App also, so that FAQ and scorecard can be checked therein !"
